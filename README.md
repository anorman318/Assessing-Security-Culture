# Assessing-Security-Culture
Research assignment on the security risks of allowing employees to use their personal devices for company work.

It’s important that all employees are aware of common security risks and treat security seriously. The majority of cyberattacks aim to exploit human weaknesses with methods like phishing.

For this reason, people are most often the weakest link in an organization’s security defenses.

**Scenario**

* Employees at SilverCorp are increasingly using their own personal devices for company work.

* Specifically, over half of all employees check their work email and communications via Slack on their personal mobile phones.

* Another 25% of employees are doing other work-related activities, using work accounts and work-related applications, on their personal phone.

* Allowing sensitive work information to be shared on employees’ personal devices has a number of security implications. You must research these security risks and use the security culture framework to develop a plan to mitigate the concerns.

**Step 1: Measure and Set Goals**

Answer the following questions:

Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.

Answer:

1. Downloading a game on their personal device they use for work off a webpage that contains malware which can infect the company network.
2. Sending files over unsecured Wi-Fi networks, which opens this information up to hackers getting to it.
3. An employee has left the company but has company applications on their personal device that they can still access. A disgruntled employee could sell data to competitors or use the information for personal gain.


Based on the previous scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?

Answer:

 1. An employee has downloaded a game on their personal device with malware.  We would prefer employees to only download apps or games from trusted app stores and not off of webpages.
2. An employee has sent a file using an unsecured wifi network at the airport.  We prefer the employee to use secure wifi spots with encryption to conduct business.
3. An employee has left the company and still has company applications on their phone.  We would prefer that the employee remove these applications or that access has been revoked by the company.

What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?

Answer:

Conduct a survey to see how employees download games and other applications.  Use monitoring tools to alert when an employee is connected to an unsecure Wi-Fi network as well as alert when a previous employee logins.

What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?

Answer:

For downloading applications and using unsecured WI-FI networks we would set a goal of less than 5% of employees doing this.  For previous employees gaining access to company applications on their personal device we would set a goal of less than 2%.

**Step 2: Involve the Right People**

Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?

List at least five employees or departments that should be involved. For each person or department, describe in 2–3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.

Answer:

1. CEO: We would involve the CEO as it is important as a company for higher up leadership to be involved and set the tone as to how important cybersecurity is.  While they won’t have an active role addressing these security risks, it is important to involve them and make them aware of the risks and requirements.

2. COO: We would want to include the COO as they are responsible for the big decisions that keep a company running as well as strategic planning.  They would be a part of any risk assessments done, making sure our policy conforms to industry guidelines and standards, as well as helping to put training into place.  As our direct line of communication to the CEO this person would be responsible for communicating any key findings to them. 

3. CIO: The CIO’s role would be to ensure that our security measures are aligning with the business’s goals.  They would work closely with the CISO and be responsible for making sure the needs of the business are being met while maintaining a secure environment.

4. CISO: As a CISO your main concern is securing all company data and systems, they would be an important person to include on our team.  They would be responsible for managing risk, setting policies and standards that protect the company assets.

5. Human Resources: They would be responsible for making sure every employee goes through training as well as for enforcing remedial training for repeat offenders.  They would also set policy for expectations and disciplinary procedures for noncompliance.

6. Security: Responsible for putting measures in place to protect against the potential threats.  Would also be responsible for the content in the training program and facilitating security awareness campaigns.  Lastly, they would monitor and collect the data for security threats.

**Step 3: Training Plan**

Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? Indicate the following:

How frequently will you run training? What format will it take (e.g., in-person, online, a combination of both)?

Answer:

Training will initially be run quarterly, with 25% of employees attending at a time so that by the end of the year all employees will have received training.  After this, follow up training will be done with those employees who have been flagged for not following policy.  The initial training will be done in person, if follow up training is needed this can be done online or in person.  Any employee who leaves or is terminated by the company will have an exit checklist to ensure applications are removed.

What topics will you cover in your training, and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)

Answer:

1. The employees responsibility to protect company data.  Placing a strong emphasis on the importance of data security and the employees responsibility to protect that data will help them take a more active role in it.  Would want your employees to know the legal obligations they have to respect and protect information.

2. Password strength and importance.  Training would include how to select a strong password and how this deters hackers.  Would also want to inform them of company policy regarding how often passwords should be changed.

3. Signs to look for if a link is suspicious.  Without being able to fully control what employees are downloading on their personal devices it would help them recognize patterns of suspicious links.  The better equips employees for making smarter decisions when opening suspicious links.

4. Email. One of the best defenses against preventing data theft is responsible email use.  It is important to understand how emailing data to outside sources could breach policy and is not a secure way of sending data.  It is also one of the most common gateways for phishing campaigns.  

5. Social engineering/phishing. It is important to equip your employees with the common techniques that hackers use to gain information to access personal or company data.

6. Securing company data based on data classification. It is important to inform your employees that different types of data need to be protected and transmitted in more secure ways due to its potential to harm the company or client’s if unauthorized users gain access.  

7. Importance of securing your device when connected to a wired or wireless network and providing examples/ways for your employees to do this. Making sure to change default passwords on the device and that they are fully updated.  Doing this will help ensure that eavesdropping from an outside source is harder to occur and this will help if an employee connects to an unsecured network.


After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness?

Answer:

Before training we would want to test to see how many employees were engaging in these behaviors and get a baseline number.  After training we would send out phishing emails to test to see how many employees download the content from it.  We would track how many employees were still connecting using unsecured WI-FI networks and lastly, we would track how many previous employees attempted to access company applications.  We would compare the two numbers and a decrease in attempts would show that the training was effective.  If the percentage has not dropped to our goal we would reevaluate the training program to see if there is an area that needs more attention.  We would then train all employees again and remeasure after the year.

**Bonus: Other Solutions**


Training alone often isn't the entire solution to a security concern.

List at least two other potential solutions. For each one, indicate the following:
  a. What type of control is it? Administrative, technical, or physical?
  b. What goal does this control have? Is it preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating?
  c. What is one advantage of each solution?
  d.What is one disadvantage of each solution?
  
 Answer:
1. Set up a VPN
 
 a. This is a technical control
    
 b. The goal of this is to create a secure access channel to the company’s network that an employee can use.  This would be a preventive measure.
    
 c. One advantage is that many VPNs require the employee to authenticate multiple times making it harder for attackers to eavesdrop on the network. 
    
 d. One disadvantage is that some VPN services require you to install and configure the software on each individual device.  Employees may not like having       something installed on their device.  This would also require time and money from the IT department that a company may not be able to allocate to.

2. Purchase a Mobile Device Management solution

a. Technical control
    
b. The goal of this control would be to provide more security on personal devices by limiting access to applications as well as providing the ability to wipe devices upon suspicion of compromise or employee termination.  This would be a preventative control in regards to overall security but also corrective if used after an event (lost employee device or termination).
  
c. An advantage is the company has more control over the company’s data on their employees personal devices.
  
d. The disadvantage is not all employees would want to give that much control of their personal device to the company.  Would not want personal data wiped in the event of a breach or lost device.
